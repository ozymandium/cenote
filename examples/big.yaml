# Your dive plan needs to be input in YAML format. Every line that starts with a `#` sign is a 
# comment, and will be ignored by the planner, so anything can go there.

# First let's pick what kind of water we're diving in. The options are "SALT" and "FRESH".
water: FRESH

# Next, pick your gradient factors. In the example below, a gradient of 55/80 has been selected.
gf:
  low: 0.55
  high: 0.8

# You need to say what kind of tanks you'll be diving with, what their starting pressures are, and
# also give a recognizable name for each one.
#
# Here's all the options for tank types:
#   AL40
#   AL80
#   LP108
#   D_LP108
#
# A simple recreactional dive might have a tank configuration like this:
#
# tanks:
#   Primary:
#     type: AL80
#     pressure: 200 bar
#     mix:
#       fO2: 0.21
#
# This just says you have a full aluminum 11.1L / 80ft^3 tank with air, and you're naming that one
# "Primary". Other options for a technical dive are shown below:
tanks:
  Sidemount:
    type: D_LP108
    pressure: 3200 psi
    mix: 
      fO2: 0.21
  Deco50:
    type: AL40
    pressure: 3000 psi
    mix: 
      fO2: 0.5
  Deco100:
    type: AL40
    pressure: 2200 psi
    mix: 
      fO2: 0.97

# Now set your surface gas consumption as a volume rate. Note that this is NOT a SAC rate, which 
# is measured as a pressure rate, and is therefore tank-specific. You have a lot of flexibility in 
# terms of what units can be used. You need to define a working and decompression SCR. 
#
# If you aren't sure, or just want to do a recreational dive, simply put the following:
#
# scr:
#   work: 1 ft^3 / min
#   deco: 1 ft^3 / min
#
# Below is an example for a technical dive with relatively high consumption:
scr: 
  work: 0.75 ft^3 / min
  deco: 0.55 ft^3 / min

# Finally, here's the part where you actually input your profile.
# Each entry in the profile is a time segment. Each segment starts at the ending depth of the 
# segment before it, and the first segment starts at zero. The "depth" you enter is that segment's
# ending depth. As such, each segment is ascending/descending/level depending upon whether the depth
# for that segment is greater/less/same as the segment before it.
#
# You do not need to enter the final ascent, as that will be planned for you.
#
# The first segment needs to have a tank specified, and you use the names you picked out above to
# do that. Whenever you populate the "tank" field in a segment, it is assumed that you swap to that
# tank at the **beginning** of the segment. Once you're specified the tank in the initial segment, 
# it's optional to set the tank for all subsequent segments.
profile:
  - {depth: 150 ft, duration: 5 min, tank: Sidemount}
  - {depth: 150 ft, duration: 35 min}
